### ü§ñ&ensp;Language and AI

I'm a machine learning researcher with a background in computational linguistics, primarily interested in representations and neural-network explainability. Currently, I'm interning at the CU Anschutz [LARK Lab](https://www.larknlp.com/), researching medical applications of language technology with [Dr. Yanjun Gao](https://serenayj.github.io/). I also collaborate with [Dr. Maria Pacheco](https://blast-cu.github.io/mlpacheco/) in CU Boulder's [BLAST Lab](https://blast-cu.github.io/), developing methods to extract, study, and make use of knowledge encoded in neural models. Come Fall, I will begin a PhD in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, studying machine learning under the supervision of [Dr. Danica Sutherland](https://www.djsutherland.ml/).

### ‚öôÔ∏è&ensp;Embedded Systems

During my Masters, I worked at Ricoh USA developing embedded systems code for [high-volume commercial printers](https://www.ricoh-usa.com/en/products/pl/equipment/commercial-and-industrial-printing/continuous-feed). Systems programming is a secondary love of mine that I don't get many chances to exercise in AI/NLP work, and Ricoh made a nice outlet for that drive. Perhaps in the future I should take up a side gig developing systems code for ML libraries ü§î.
