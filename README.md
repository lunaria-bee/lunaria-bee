### 🤖&ensp;Language and AI

I'm a Masters student in Computational Linguistics at the University of Colorado, Boulder, interested in the intersections of language and artificial intelligence, especially representations of knowledge and concepts. In addition to my coursework, I currently research neuro-symbolic methods for NLP with [Dr. Maria Pacheco](https://blast-cu.github.io/mlpacheco/) in CU's [BLAST Lab](https://blast-cu.github.io/). My present interest is in developing methods to extract, study, and make use of the knowledge encoded in neural models.

### ⚙️&ensp;Embedded Systems

Outside of school, I write embedded systems code for [high-volume commercial printers at Ricoh, USA](https://www.ricoh-usa.com/en/products/pl/equipment/commercial-and-industrial-printing/continuous-feed). Systems programming is a secondary love of mine, and one that I don't get many chances to exercise in AI/NLP work, so Ricoh makes a nice outlet for that drive. Perhaps in the future I should take up a side gig in ML systems 🤔.
